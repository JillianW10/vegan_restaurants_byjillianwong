          <h2>Together we can make a difference!</h2>
          <p>Veganism can make a big environmental impact because it reduces the demand for animal agriculture, which is resource intensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. Supporting vegan restaurants can be a way to make eco-conscious food choices.
